A vector may have many definitions: a point in space, an ordered list of numbers, a quantity with magnitude and
direction, etc. More abstractly, a vector is simply an element of a [vector space](#vector-space). All these diverse 
things are gathered under the common name of vector because, for certain types of questions, a common way of reasoning 
can be applied to all of them.
